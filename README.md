# Ouroboros

Ouroboros is an experimental programming language.

It will attempt to abstract away things that most languages do not, and experiment with what powerful tools this gives programmers.
As such, it will be possible for people to write *really* bad code in this language.

That said, it is possible to write really bad code in any language.
Like a sharp knife, this will be a powerful tool.
We make no attempt to stop this, it's up to the user not to cut themselves.

## Technical ideas

Some technical ideas of language features to come:

### Able to iterate over statements in a function

For ease of compiling/meta-programming.

### Equality of functions

Two functions `f`, and `g` are considered equal (`f == g`) if they are defined at the same point in the source code, and their containing scopes are equal.
Scopes are equal if the functions creating them are equal, and all of their variables are equal.

I've considered having `f == g` if they are
[alpha equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence),
but decided against it, as two functions may be alpha equivalent, but not
[semantically equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_equivalence).

eg. The constructors

```
person = (name, age) => { ... };
company = (name, age) => { ... };
```

may happen to be alpha equivalent, but they represent different objects.

### Ability to modify the syntax from within the language

Bit of a long-term goal.
Not thought too much about this, yet.

Ideally, I want to be able to completely rewrite the syntax of the language from within itself.
To demonstrate this, I'd like to be able to start with something C-like, and end up with

## Setup

Ensure Python is installed.
Ouroboros is developed in Python 3.6, but may work in other versions.
Then run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Ouroboros is currently written as an interpreter, in Python.

    python -m ouroboros [-h] [file]

## Examples

Look in the [`examples`](examples) directory for a number of examples.
